Think step-by-step. You must strictly follow the steps sequentially.

Return your answer in under 4096 tokens.

Step 1. Retrieve all raw tract descriptions from the images provided to you. But refrain from putting the raw description in the output. If there is 'LEGAL DESCRIPTION' in the document, search the raw description there; otherwise search the entire document. The tract descriptions may be found in multiple pages and be associated with multiple counties. If there are no specific tract descriptions, just return "<final_output> [] </final_output>" and skip all remaining steps. Refrain from omitting any raw descriptions.

Step 2. Identify all individual tracts. Refrain from skipping tracts for brevity. If the tracts are numbered in the documents, check if they actually contain multiple individual tracts and return them as separate individual tracts.

Step 3. For each of the tracts in Step 2, follow <instruction> to search for the requested fields.

The requested fields are: "state", "county", "abstract", "survey", "subdivision", "lot", "subdivision_block", "section", "township", "range_block", "quarter", and "acreage".

Only return the requested fields that are specifically stated in the document. Combine the requested fields into a JSON object. Return one JSON object per tract.

Refrain from inferring or deriving any information from the document. Refrain from returning fields that is not requested. Refrain from returning null.

You must follow the instruction to extract the fields, including the format of the fields.

Example of one tract: {'tract': 1, 'state': 'Texas', 'county': 'Travis', 'abstract': 'A-546', 'survey': 'T&P RR CO SURVEY', 'subdivision': 'Flatrock Creek Phase 1', 'lot': '1', 'subdivision_block': '1', 'section': '5', 'township': 'T-4-S', 'range_block': '5', 'quarter': 'N/2 N/2', 'acreage': '126.3'} 

If the answers to all fields are null or zero, the response should be an empty JSON object {}. Only return valid JSON.

<instruction>
- Assign a sequential tract number.
- Identify the state.
- Identify the counties. Get all values from the document. One tract can have multiple counties. If there are multiple counties, return their corresponding states. Example {'tract':1, 'state': 'Texas; Texas', 'county': 'Glasscock; Reagan', ...}
- Identify all abstracts in the raw tract(format: A-####, the letter 'A' followed by a few digits, optionally with a hyphen in-between. Example: 'A-1456' or 'A136'). One tract can have multiple abstracts.
- Identify the survey name (sometimes called the original grantee).
- Identify the subdivision. Subdivision is found when there is a stated "Subdivision", "Division" or "Addition".
- Identify the lot number, which must be indicated with the keywork 'Lot'. The value "Three (3)" should be a numeric "3". Do not split the lot values if there are multiple. Return them in one tract. Example: {'tract':1, ..., 'lot': '7, 8, 9', ...}
- Identify the subdivision block the tract of land is located in. Subdivision block value is found when there is a Subdivision.
- Extract the section number. In some cases, section number might have the 'Survey' prefix. Example: 'Survey 123' means 123 is the section number.
- Identify the range block (often labeled as "Block"). Range block are found when a "Section" is described.
- Identify the township. Township is found when the "Section" and "Range block" are described. Township value must follows the format: "T-<digit>-<direction>" and could be separated by a hyphen, such as 'T5S' and 'T-2-E'.
- Extract all quarter descriptions exactly as written. Sometimes it starts with directional word such as 'South One-Fourth (S/4)', sometimes it contains directional notations such as 'E/4'.
- Extract the acreage of the tract. Acreage must be indicated with keywords like 'acres' or 'acreage'.
</instruction>

Refrain from returning these raw JSONs in your answer.

Refrain from being verbose. 

Step 4. From the output of Step 3, validate that only the requested fields are included. Delete any other fields.

Step 5. From the output of Step 4, if the JSON only contains 'tract', 'state' and 'county', discard that tract entry. Skip all remaining steps and return "<final_output> [] </final_output>".

Step 6. For surveys: Ensure the full survey name is captured, even if it spans multiple lines.

Step 7. For section: If there are multiple sections, separate them into separate tracts.

Step 8. For quarter: If multiple quarters are present, create separate JSON objects.
- Example: "N/2 of N/2 and N/2 of S/2" should result in two tract entries.
- Example: "Southeast Quarter (SE/4) and the Southeast Quarter of the Northeast Quarter (SE/4 NE/4)" should result in two tract entries.
- Example: "NE/4; NE/4 NE/4" should result in two tract entries.

Step 9. Simplify quarter descriptions:
- Remove words, keeping only directional notations.
- Example: "North One-Half (N/2)" becomes "N/2".
- Example: "N/2 of N/2" becomes "N/2 N/2".

Step 10. For quarter: Verify the format of quarter. It must be a directional notation followed by a number, e.g. "S/2". If you can only extract the direction but not the number, do not return the value for quarter, e.g. do not return "E".

Step 11. If multiple abstracts apply to a single tract, join them with a semicolon. A single tract means all other attributes are exactly the same except for abstracts.
Example: "abstract": "A-545; A-645" when document states 'A-545, Glasscock County, Texas, and A-645, Glasscock County, Texas, containing 15 acres'.

Step 12. If multiple counties apply to a single tract, join them with a semicolon.
Example: "county": "Glasscock; Reagan"

Step 13. For section: If both section and subdivision are present, append the section to the end of subdivision and discard the 'section' field.

Step 14. Verify the format of the township. Sometimes '5' and 'S' are easily mixed up. If the tonwship appears to be 'TSS', you know it is the wrong format and should output 'T5S' instead.

Step 15. From the output of Step 14, format the output as a list of JSON objects, each representing a single tract. Include the final output in XML <final_output> tags. Example:
<final_output>
[
  {
    "tract": 1,
    "state": "Texas; Texas",
    "county": "Glasscock; Reagan",
    "abstract": "A-545; A-645",
    "survey": "T&P RR Co Survey",
    "section": "37",
    "range_block": "35",
    "township": "T5S",
    "quarter": "S/2",
    "acreage": "115"
  },
  ...
]
</final_output>


Important:
- Retrieve complete raw tract descriptions.
- Include only fields that are explicitly mentioned in the document.
- Ensure all JSON objects are properly formatted and closed.
- Double-check that all relevant information has been captured for each tract.
- Verify that quarters have been properly split into separate tracts when necessary.
- Verify that multiple abstracts, multiple counties, multiple surveys in a tract have been properly joined.
